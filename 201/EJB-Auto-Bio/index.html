        <h1>Welcome to the home page</h1>

        <p>Hello, my name is Emma and welcome to my page. Here you will learn a bit about me.</p>

        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>I was born in Kentucky, but moved with my family to Mount Pleasant, Iowa when I was 9. I've lived in Iowa
            ever
            since! I graduated from Mount Pleasant Community High School, where I was active in band, choir, and theatre
            as
            well as taking several AP classes.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>In 2013, I graduated from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa. I majored in Biochemistry and Molecular
            Biology and graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I remained in band and choir throughout choir, and was involved in a
            sorority,
            Beta Psi Eta.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p>After graduating college, I worked for about two years for Roquette America Inc, where my job was performing
            quality control testing on high fructose corn syrup and dextrose. After that, I was able to get a job with
            the
            University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals. In this role, I performed quality control testing as well as other
            studies
            on pharmaceutical drug products. Most of these were in various stages of clinical research. I was in this
            position for eight years before I changed fields to pursure computer science.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>Since pursuing a career change, my new goal is to complete the coding program throuhg DeltaV Code School,
            then get a job as a developer. At this stage, I don't know what kind of company I would most like to work
            for. I
            enjoy creative pursuits such as music and art, but I also have a great deal of experience in the biological
            and
            chemical sciences and would be interested in working for a pharmaceutical company.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy making digital art, playing the piano, and I am writing a fantasy novel. I have an
            amazing husband, Drew, as well as two cats and a dog.</p>

# Psychological Safety

## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Teams were more successful when team members: 

- Spent roughly equal amounts of time talking

- Are open enough to talk about how they are feeling

- Listen to one another and show sensitivity to others' needs

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

In my previous job, there was not psychological safely insofar as the whole group was concerned. There were a few team members who were judgemental and hostile, and it affected the cohesion of the group as a whole. People would be afraid to admit they had made mistakes and many members hardly participated at all.

## What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

If a team operates with a high degreee of psychological safety, the company performs better and the team members are more satisfied with their job and their work.

[Source: MDN, Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

## Q1 Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Early online videos and audio primarily used plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. However, they had security and accessibility issues, and now native HTML solutions (using <video> and <audio> elements) with JavaScript APIs are preferred.

## Q2 Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

The <src> attribute is used to link to the source, the same as with an image. The <control> attribute allows the user to start and stop playback, as well as adjust the volume.

## Q3 Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

It's important to have fallback content in case the user is on an older browser that doesn't support the <video> element.

## Q4 Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

<audio>: Can you hear me now?

<video>: Yes!

<audio>: Good! Can you see me now?

<video>: No.

## Q5 How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

Grid layout lets you control in two diminsions - that is, both rows and columns. Flex layout can go either vertically or horizontally, but you can't control both at the same time.

## Q6 Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

- **Grid container** is the parent of the grid items. It forms the border of all of the items contained inside.

- **Grid items** are the children (*direct* descendants) of the grid container. These are the major items contained within the grid container.

- **Grid lines** are the dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid.

## Q7 Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

- Art direction problem - If a large image isn't cropped correctly for a smaller screen (art direction problem), it will either take up too much of the screen, or will be cropped in a way that you can't see the focus of the image.

- Resolution switching problems - If a large image, suitable for a desktop or laptop, is displayed at full size on smaller screens it will waste bandwidth. If an image intended for a small screen is shown on a large screen it will lose resolution.

## Q8 Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

- srcset lets you list multiple image sources with their sizes.

- sizes lets you list the size of the screen width, indicating which version of the image is best to use.

For example, in the code: 

<img
  srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
         800px"
  src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
  alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />

srcset lists two file names ('elva-fairy-480w.jpg' and 'elva-fairy-800w.jpg') followed by their intrinsic size in pixels, using w as the unit label ('480w' and '800w')

sizes lists the media condition which is the cutoff point ('max-width: 600px'), followed by the width of the slot if the media condition evaluates to true, followed by false. This can be compared to a ternary operator in JS. So, if the screen is less than 600px it will display the image in srcset that is 480px. Otherwise, it will display the 800px width image.

## Q9 How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

It's better to use srcset in HTML, as HTML is loaded before CSS or JS.

## Q4 What is meant by “normal flow”?

"Normal flow" means the way that webpage elements lay themselves out, if you haven't changed their layout. The default layout for CSS elements.

## Q5 What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

[Source](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)

Block-level elements and inline elements are the two display values. Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. They always takes up the full width available.

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

An inline element does not start on a new line, and only takes up as much width as necessary.

ex - <span>

## Q6 ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

Static.

## Q7 Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

 Absolute positioning allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. It is not affected by other elements and it doesn’t affect other elements.

## Q8 What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

[Source](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS_absolute_and_fixed_positioning?source=post_page#:~:text=Absolutely%20positioned%20elements%20are%20positioned,is%20always%20their%20containing%20block.)

Elements with absolute positioning overlap other content unless you make room for them.

Elements with fixed positioning always appear at the same place inside the browser window when viewed on screen.

## Learn JS

## Q9 Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

A function declaration defines what a function takes in as a parameter and what functionality it will perform (output). Nothing happens when you define a function other than storing the definition in memory.

A function invocation is where the function is acutally executed.

## Q10 What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

A parameter is the placeholder in the function and the argument is the actual value that is the input for the function.

## Misc

## Q11 Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

Pair programming is helpful because of the ability to learn from other students, and preparation for a job. Because there is so much to learn, pretty much any other student is going to know some things that I don't know and can help me learn new things. As well, it's very good practice for future jobs, as this is a standard practice in a professional environment.

## Things I want to know more about

The CSS layout stuff is still kind of confusing. There is a lot of vocab to remember and keep track of whick type of positioning does what, and when each should be used.

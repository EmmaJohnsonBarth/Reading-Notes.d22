Block-level elements and inline elements are the two display values. Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. They always takes up the full width available.

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

An inline element does not start on a new line, and only takes up as much width as necessary.

## Q2 Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

Parsing essentially means translating into a usable format. Occurs in a specific order.

HTML is parsed first. It sees style and script tags, and requests that information and parses it once it comes back.

Browser generates DOM tree from parsed HTML, CSSOM from parsed CSS, then compiles and executes parsed JS.

## Q4 How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

## Q1 To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?

Psychological safety had a large impact on my previous work experience, because there was a small handfull of individuals who did not make people feel psychologically safe. This had a large impact on the workplace culture and turnover rate, and it also prevented us from speaking up about it to management to fix the problem.

## Q2 How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?

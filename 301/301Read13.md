## Q3 Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

Both REST and CRUD are guidelines for how many web applications handle data. REST sets the guidelines for how websites communicate, and CRUD is an explaination of the operations that can be performed on data.

## Q4 If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Identify resources (information) that the API will use

2. Determine URIs that will be used

3. Select HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for each URI based on what you want to do

4. Write the code for the endpoints (URI and HTTP method combination)

5. Test and handle errors
